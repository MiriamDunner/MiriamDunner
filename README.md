## 🚀 About Me

Full Stack & Embedded Developer, graduate of MAHAT and the KamaTech Ultra Code program.  
Skilled in designing scalable systems, modern web applications, and computer-vision pipelines.

Developed an automated **satellite-image anomaly-detection module** focusing on sensor-related defects, including **smear, dead pixels, and signal inconsistencies**.  
Designed a custom **OpenCV + Fourier Transform algorithm** that produced higher-resolution anomaly masks and **reduced false positives**, significantly improving detection reliability.

Experienced in building full-stack systems using **React, Node.js, .NET Core, MongoDB, MySQL**, and modern DevOps workflows with CI/CD pipelines.
